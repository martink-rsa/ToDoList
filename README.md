# ToDoList: A TOP Assignment

This is a To-Do List made in HTML/CS/JavaScript for The Odin Project curriculum. The assignment details can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list?ref=lnav).

## Personal Goals

It is a goal of mine to write this solution using the same way a Factory Function pattern is used in the article [S.O.L.I.D The first 5 principles of Object Oriented Design with JavaScript](https://medium.com/@cramirez92/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-5-priciples-of-object-oriented-design-with-javascript-790f6ac9b9fa) by Cristian Ramirez (09/01/2017). This meant using Factory Functions that were dynamic as well as made use of an Interface.
